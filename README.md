True Image Effects for Unity free

Introduction:
Welcome! This here is the Indie Effects pack, one of the only free ways of getting image effects in Unity free. With this epic pack, you can do fisheye lensing, motion blur, bloom and lighting FX, SSAO, vignetting, chromatic aberration, radial blur, and an easy to use API to code your own FX!
But where’s the motion blur you ask? Unfortunately, an improvement in performance came at the cost of breaking the original motion blur, so for now, there is none. I am working on a camera-based solution that uses motion vectors instead.

Basic Setup and Use in Unity Free:
Here are the basic setup steps. Unlike previous versions, it isn’t as fiddly as it was anymore! Now, let’s get started:
1.	First, open the project you are going to use these FX in, then extract the IndieEffects.zip to your assets folder. This can be done in windows by opening the .zip, then clicking “extract all files” at the top.
2.	Once Unity finishes importing the package, go to your main camera, and click “Add Component” then browse to the newly created “Indie Effects” section, then add an effect of your choice. To use motion blur, add the base script, then enable motion blur. For other FX, these auto-add the base script automatically, if it isn’t there already.
3.	If you want to tweak your newly added FX, then head to the “Tweaking” section of this doc for details, otherwise skip this step.
4.	To use some fx, you will need to tick the checkbox marked “DNRequire” mainly for DoF
5.	Click play to preview. Behold… YOUR NEW FX!
